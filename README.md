# EDCOP-Containers
EDCOP Docker Containers for applications

All containers use the official elastic images and add small configuration changes on top of them. The current version for Elastic docker images is 5.4.1, and is available from Elastic's Docker hub. 

# Installation
Please consult the configuration guide for steps on how to install and configure these services. By default, we have disabled X-Pack paid services as they require a subscription with Elastic beyond the 30 day trial.
